/**
 * @brief Calculates the number of steps to reduce a non-negative integer to zero using bitwise operations.
 *
 * The rules for reduction are:
 * - If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
 * - If the current number is odd, you have to subtract 1 from it.
 *
 * @param num The non-negative integer to reduce.
 * @return int The total number of steps taken.
 *
 * ## Overall Approach
 * This function is a more optimized version that uses bitwise operations to achieve the same
 * result as the arithmetic version. It directly simulates the process in a `while` loop.
 * - To check for evenness, it uses a bitwise AND (`&`) with 1. If the result is 0, the
 * number's least significant bit is 0, meaning it's even.
 * - To divide by 2, it uses the bitwise right shift operator (`>>= 1`), which is often
 * faster than arithmetic division.
 *
 * ## Time Complexity: O(log N)
 * The complexity is logarithmic with respect to the input `num` (N). Each right shift (`>>`)
 * effectively halves the number, and each subtraction (`--`) on an odd number guarantees a
 * right shift in the next step. The number of operations is proportional to the number of
 * bits in the binary representation of `num`, which is logâ‚‚(N).
 *
 * ## Space Complexity: O(1)
 * The algorithm uses only a fixed number of variables (`num`, `count`) regardless of the
 * size of the input. Therefore, the space complexity is constant.

        // `(num & 1)` isolates the least significant bit (LSB).
