/**
 * @brief Calculates the number of steps to reduce a non-negative integer to zero.
 *
 * The rules for reduction are:
 * - If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
 * - If the current number is odd, you have to subtract 1 from it.
 *
 * @param num The non-negative integer to reduce.
 * @return int The total number of steps taken.
 *
 * ## Overall Approach
 * The function works by directly simulating the process described. It uses a `while` loop
 * that continues as long as the number is greater than zero. Inside the loop, it checks
 * if the number is even or odd and performs the appropriate operation, incrementing a
 * step counter each time. The loop terminates when the number reaches zero, and the
 * total count is returned.
 *
 * ## Time Complexity: O(log N)
 * The time complexity is logarithmic with respect to the input number `num` (N).
 * This is because dividing an even number by 2 is equivalent to a bitwise right shift,
 * which rapidly reduces the magnitude of the number. Subtracting 1 from an odd number
 * always makes it even, guaranteeing a division by 2 in the next step. The number of
 * operations is proportional to the number of bits in the binary representation of `num`,
 * which is logâ‚‚(N).
 *
 * ## Space Complexity: O(1)
 * The algorithm uses only a fixed number of variables (`num`, `count`) regardless of the
 * size of the input. Therefore, the space complexity is constant.
